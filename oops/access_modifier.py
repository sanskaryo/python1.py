# Access Specifiers/Modifiers
# Access specifiers or access modifiers in python programming are used to limit the access 
# of class variables and class methods outside of class while implementing the concepts of inheritance.

#Name mangling   Name mangling
# Name mangling in Python is a technique used to protect class-private and superclass-private attributes from being accidentally overwritten by subclasses. Names of class-private and superclass-private attributes are transformed by the addition of a single leading underscore and a double leading underscore respectively.


class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._nonmangled_attribute = "I am a nonmangled attribute"
        self.__mangled_attribute = "I am a mangled attribute"

my_object = MyClass()

print(my_object._nonmangled_attribute) # Output: I am a nonmangled attribute
print(my_object.__mangled_attribute) # Throws an AttributeError
print(my_object._MyClass__mangled_attribute) # Output: I am a mangled attribute
